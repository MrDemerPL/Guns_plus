This is a java plugin for the Minecraft server software Bukkit.
It allows you to create your very own guns and ammo for these!
The properties of the items can be set in the configuration files.
Enjoy! :)

***TO-DO***
	 * ---NEW---
	 * 1. Better fire rate...perhaps with a milisecond timer instead of ticks
	 * 2. Enable the auto target and shoot system of the tripod block    
	 * 3. Hook into certain plugins: Citizens(request that npcs can held guns an use them), Chestshop(guns should be sellable)
	 *    MoreMaterials (you should be able to use MM items in gun recipes)
	 * 4. Make magazines as ammo, which contains a specific amount of bullets to safe inventory space
	 * 5. Add "Number of Bullets" option (fireing takes config amount of ammo each shot)
	 * 6. Add Area of Effect option (such as targetenity in effects, area that is influnced)
	 * ---FIX---
	 * 1. HUD should overlay the zoomtexture 
	 * 2. The file data.dat has a bunch of empty lines before the actual data  
     * 3. !!! Need to fix Block Break error with Double to Integer Conversion !!!
