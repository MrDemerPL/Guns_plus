This is a java plugin for the Minecraft server software Bukkit.
It allows you to create your very own guns and ammo for these!
The properties of the items can be set in the configuration files.
Enjoy! :)

***TO-DO***
	 * ---NEW---
	 * 1. Better fire rate...perhaps with a milisecond timer instead of ticks
	 * 2. Improve target detection
	 * 3. Placeable Guns: make guns mountable on a tripod and make tripod-gun combination;  
	 * 4. Explosion damage protect  # perhaps do it like the explosion effect keeps but no damage to blocks  
	 * 5. Hook into certain plugins: Citizens(request that npcs can held guns an use them), Chestshop(guns should be sellable)
	 *    MoreMaterials (you should be able to use MM items in gun recipes)# hooked into MM, but not sure if it works
	 * 6. Make magazines as ammo, which contains a specific amount of bullets to safe inventory space
	 * 7. Add "Number of Bullets" option (fireing takes config amount of ammo each shot)
	 * 8. Add Area of Effect option (such as targetenity in effects, area that is influnced)
	 * ---FIX---
	 * 1. HUD should overlay the zoomtexture 
	 * 2. improve smoke effects (lower density)
