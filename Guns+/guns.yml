    # here you can define the accuracy of the gun: the random-factor basically defines a certain hit randomness; the spread angle, separated by the pointer (->) defines the spread if zoomed in or out
    # missing-chance defines a chance of missing the target in percent. e.g. 50 means the gun misses every second shot. Again the pointer separates between zoomed or not
    # this nodes can be modified to very custom accuracy values.
